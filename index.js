// comparison operators enable us to check to see if a value is what we're expecting.
// JavaScript includes both strict and loose comparison operators. 
// When writing JavaScript, you should strongly prefer the strict operators.
// The reason for this is the loose operators will return true even if the data types aren't the same,
//  which can result in unexpected behavior and bugs that can be difficult to track down.

/*JavaScript includes four equality operators:

strict equality operator (===)
strict inequality operator (!==)
loose equality operator (==)
loose inequality operator (!=)
These operators allow us to compare values and determine whether they are the same.*/


/*Compare Numbers with Relational Operators
JavaScript includes four relational operators:

greater than (>)
greater than or equals (>=)
less than (<)
less than or equals (<=) 

The behavior of these operators is consistent with the meaning of 
the corresponding symbols in mathematics:*/

// Stick to comparing numerical values with the relational operators and you'll be golden
